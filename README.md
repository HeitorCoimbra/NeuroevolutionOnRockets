Genetic algorithm applied to optimize neural networks weights.

The network dictates if the agent is going to turn right or left, or not turn at all. The input of the networks is the proximity measured by 24 virtual sensors on the front of the agent.

The agents' target is the tiny white ball located on the right side of the screen. As soon as one of the agent apporaches the target, it moves to a harder position.

The fitness of each agent is displayed by their side in white, and its a measure of how far from the start and how close to the target it gets.

The number of agents alive in the current population is displayed on the top right corner of the screen, in red

After a certain number o agents has failed, the sensors will be displayed for better visualization.
